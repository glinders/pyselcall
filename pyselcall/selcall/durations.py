class Durations(object):
    """
    This class is an iterable that produces the duration values for use in the
    Code class to build frequency, duration pairs. It is designed to always
    provide a value, even if the duration-tuple has fewer values than what is
    requested, repeating the last value of the duration infinitely if given
    a tuple of frequencies.

    It's really only doing this because the Ericsson style has a different
    duration of the first note than all the others, but can act as a place to
    insert other weird timing schemes if one is ever needed.
